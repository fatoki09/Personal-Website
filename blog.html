        <h4 class = "heading">A Royal Heartbreak: My Journey as a Sacramento Kings Fan</h4>
        <p class = "junction"> Written by <a href = "about.html">Ramon Flores</a> on January 11, 2013 at 5:00 PM.</p>

        <p class = "junction">When I was only six years old, my family took me to see my first ever Kings game. It was game 4 of the first round of the playoffs and the Kings we're playing John Stockton, Karl Malone, and the Utah Jazz. The Kings were the new kids on the block, with rising stars Jason Williams and Peja Stojakovic and the best big man duo of Chris Webber and Vlade Divac. I didn't know much about basketball, but the atmosphere at the stadium was incredible. Cowbells were ringing everywhere and we got so loud that Utah coach Jerry Sloan even had to wear earplugs. We ended up losing the game on a Stockton three, but this single game sparked in me a genuine love for basketball that continues to this day. This marked a golden age for the Kings and I will never forget Jason Williams' no look passes and Vlade blowing kisses to the crowd.</p>

        <p class = "junction">The next few years were the best years of my life as a sports fan. The Kings were a perennial power and championship contenders. We traded J-Will for Mike Bibby and signed ultra-defender Doug Christie as well as future sixth man Bobby Jackson. It was the perfect team. Sports Illustrated even called us "The Greatest Show on Court," because the Kings showed exactly how basketball is supposed to be played. Our offense was beautiful -- players were always moving and nearly every basket was an assisted one. In 2002, we were the heavy favorites to win the championship until the referees rigged game 6 and we lost the series to the hated Lakers. I thought we would win again the following year, but Chris Webber tore his ACL. I didn't realize it at the time, but that was the end of the Kings glory days. C-Webb came back towards the end of the next season, but he wasn't the same. He couldn't make explosive moves to the basketball nor get rebounds over two or three people. Regardless, we were a three-pointer away from making the Western Conference Finals but still came up short.</p>

        <p class = "junction">We made the playoffs a couple of years after that, but for the most part being a Kings fan has been disappointing and frustrating up to this point. We never seemed to make the right moves from then on and our players never seemed to reach their full potential. We haven't even been close to making the playoffs since 2006. Just a couple of days ago, I heard some news that was more heartbreaking than the past six or seven season of losing: Seattle investors were negotiating with the Maloofs (owners of the Kings) to relocate the team to Seattle.</p>

        <p class = "junction">I was on my way to class when I heard this and I couldn't help but check Twitter the entire class to see all of the updates. I reminisced on all of the memories I've had as a Kings fan and how thankful I am to have grown up with Mike Bibby, Peja Stojakovic, Chris Webber, and Vlade Divac. I can remember Chris Webber knocking down John Stockton in 1999, Mike Bibby's game winner against the Lakers in 2002, Peja Stojakovic's game-tying three against the T-Wolves in 2004, and Kevin Martin's buzzer beater against the Spurs in 2006. I can remember them as clear as day. The thing is, whether or not the Kings were the best or the worst team in the league, I've loved them the same. I've always had the same passion for them. I will always come to my computer or TV when the Kings are playing and I will always get nervous when they are in a close game. TNT's Kenny Smith said it best, "When we were winning or we were losing, it was always the same in Sacramento." Regardless of who are players are, I will always support the team and come October I am always looking forward to a new season of Sacramento basketball. It would truly be a travesty to have the Kings leave such a great city and such a LOYAL and DEVOTED fanbase.</p>

        <p class = "junction">Honestly speaking, the Kings have the best fanbase in the NBA. Of the 19 seasons where we've sold out EVERY game, only 10 of those season were we a playoff team. We have the most loyal fans in the NBA. We have the record for most consecutive sellouts by an NBA franchise and formerly held the world record for loudest sports roar. I can't think of another fanbase that makes other teams wear earplugs during their games. I can't think of other arenas where players can't hear their coaches calling out a play or calling a timeout. You see, Sacramento isn't a big city like LA or San Francisco. It has a much more intimate environment and everyone comes out to the games to support together as a community. It's not just about the team, it's about the city. No other NBA city can replicate the dedication and basketball atmosphere we have here in Sacramento. </p>

        <p class = "junction">Do I feel for Seattle for losing the SuperSonics? Yeah, I do. But at the same time I do realize that the Sonics never meant as much to them as the Kings do to Sacramentans. Seattle has the Mariners, the Sounders, and the Seahawks who are currently in the playoffs. They never loved Gary Payton and Ray Allen as much as they did Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander. When Chris Webber was traded to Sacramento, he outwardly spoke of how he did not want to be there. We still welcomed him with open arms and even had a city wide celebration when he came to the city and even when he returned from his ACL injury. He now loves the city and still has a restaurant there. In fact, I can see his jersey hanging from the rafters whenever I come to a game. There's nothing like basketball in Sacramento and I'm truly praying that Sacramento will beat the offers from Seattle firms and keep the Kings where they truly belong -- the place where they will be loved by the most loyal fans in the sport. Hopefully one day, I will be able to celebrate an NBA championships with my favorite team in all of sports in my hometown of Sacramento.</p>

        <p class = "junction"> Written by <a href = "about.html">Ramon Flores</a> on January 8, 2013 at 3:17 PM.</p>

        <p class = "junction"> My sister is finishing up her college apps, and I was just thinking how crazy it is that we're both going to be in college next year. I'm hoping that she'll be going to a college in the bay area (Santa Clara, Cal, etc.) so that it'll be easy for us to hang out and for my parents to visit the both of us. I remember the college admissions process and it's pretty cool to see her go through it as well. I'm so proud of her and I can't wait to see what college she ends up going to!</p>

      <h4 class = "heading">Winter Quarter 2013</h4>
      <p class = "junction"> Written by <a href = "about.html">Ramon Flores</a> on January 8, 2013 at 12:16 AM.</p>

      <div>

        <p class = "junction">So I've had a couple of days to settle back into college life again, so I thought I'd write a post about my classes and what I want to do this quarter. I'm taking 16 units this quarter from 4 CS classes. I've never taken more than 2 computer science classes in a single quarter, so I will have to adjust somewhat to being on the computer literally the entire day. At the same time, I'm going to learn so much this quarter and I can't wait.</p>

        <p class = "junction">My first class is CS 110: systems. The first lecture seemed a bit dry, but knowing about the hardware and exactly how computers run seems to be a valuable skill and I've heard the programming assignments are very good as well. My second class is CS 103: logic. My favorite professor, <a href = "http://www.keithschwarz.com" target = "_blank"> Keith Schwarz </a> is teaching the class and his first lecture was funny and awesome in general. I haven't taken a math class in over a year but this one seems to be a good one. More on my other two classes later because they begin tomorrow.</p>

        <p class = "junction">In terms of this quarter, I want to be more efficient and productive with my time in general. I'm hoping to sleep a little earlier (1-2 AM rather than 3-4 AM) so I can feel energized in the morning. I'm hoping to swim a mile to a mile and a half every morning before class, play some basketball in the evenings, and eat much healthier in general. I also want to be more efficient when I am doing homework without distractions such as ESPN, facebook, or FIFA 13. Most of all, I hope to interview well at tech companies and land a software engineering internship this summer. I'd love the opportunity to work for a company and gain industry experience while developing as a programmer. Lastly, I want to explore more. There's so much more Stanford has to offer that I haven't seen yet. I hope to visit some more of the frats and houses on the row and check out more of the surrounding areas -- Palo Alto, Mountain View, San Jose.</p>

        <p class = "junction">I'm excited to come back to a fresh quarter and I'm ready to make more memories with all of my friends.</p>

      <div>

        <p class = "junction">So I'm back at Stanford now (post on that coming soon) and I've just found out that three of our top defenders are returning for next year! That means that we should be returning 9 starters (everyone but Chase Thomas and Terrence Stephens). Our defense is deep and their replacements look to be great players as well. I couldn't be more excited! I've found that the saying "offense wins games, defense wins championships" is so true and I hope that will propel us to a national championship come next season.</p>

        <p class = "junction">It's always nice to take a break from school and come home to family and friends for winter break. However, I felt that this winter break was special. I spent even more time with family and friends than usual and I've had some memorable moments. My holiday season, spending time with family and going to the Rose Bowl, was nothing short of amazing. I've even managed to be productive at the same time. I've interviewed with some tech companies and redesigned my entire website from scratch. Here are some highlights of my winter break.</p>

        <ol>
          <li> 
            <h6 class = "heading">Going to the Rose Bowl</h6>
            <p class = "junction">You can read my previous post for more about this, but this was one of the sports moments I will never forget. The atmosphere was unforgettable. I'm getting even more excited for next season and hoping that I'll be back in Pasadena next year -- this time for the BCS national championship game.</p>

          <li>
            <h6 class = "heading">Christmas Eve/Day</h6>
            <p class = "junction">We had some quality family time on Christmas eve and Christmas day with all of the cousins and parents playing Catch Phrase, table tennis, mahjong just dance and karaoke-ing. I've grown up extremely close to all of my cousins and being the first of them to leave for college was tough. I missed them a lot and it was great to spend time with them for the holidays and open up presents together.</p>

            <h6 class = "heading">New Year's Eve</h6>
            <p class = "junction">Counting down to the New Year is always fun, but it's even better when you're doing so with all of your cousins from Sacramento. We didn't do anything super special, but just being in their company made for an amazing time.</p>
          </li>   
        </ol>

        <p class = "junction">There were so many fun moments this break that I don't have the endurance to type out. Gabby's debut was fun and I got to see my cousin Kevin for the first time in a while. I had a great time playing basketball and hanging out with all of my high school friends. It's crazy how time flies and it even makes me miss high school a lot at times. I am honestly so grateful to God for blessing me with such an amazing and tight-knit family and caring friends. I'll leave Sacramento tomorrow afternoon (after Andrew Luck plays the Ravens) and I'm looking forward to another great quarter at Stanford. More on that later. </p>

        <h4 class = "heading"> 2013 Rose Bowl </h4>
        <p class = "junction"> Written by <a href = "about.html">Ramon Flores</a> on January 2, 2013 at 11:15 PM.</p>

        <div>
          <img src = "images/roseBowl.png" class = "right" width = "250">

          <p class = "junction">I spent New Year's Day with my dad in Pasadena to watch my Stanford Cardinal take on the Wisconsin Badgers in the 99th Rose Bowl Game presented by Vizio. Needless to say, I couldn't have kicked off 2013 any better. On September 16th, I tweeted that Stanford was going to the Rose Bowl and they in fact did, proving hundreds of experts wrong. Our team lost star Andrew Luck to the NFL and many thought we would not be nearly as good, but out defense really stepped up and proved to be one of the best in the nation.</p>

          <p class = "junction">So back to the Rose Bowl. At 6 AM on New Year's Day, my dad and I left to drive over to Pasadena. We stopped at Burger King for some breakfast and began our five hour journey. Along the way, we stopped by for some gas and some snacks. We knew we were close when there was traffic backed up in the freeway. It took us about an hour to travel the two miles from the freeway exit to the actual parking area, which was on an 18-hole golf course.</p>

          <p class = "junction">Once we parked, we could see the vast array of red and white from Stanford and Wisconsin fans alike. Fans from both schools tailgated amongst each other and I had to take a second look to see if certain people were from Wisconsin or Stanford. We then walked around the entire arena to get our tickets, which by the way were the most beautiful looking tickets I have ever seen. After eating a not so delicious burrito and a cinnamon roll, it was finally time for the game.</p>

          <img src = "http://www.athletictravel.com/system/storage/47/3a/3/160/header_RoseBowl.jpg" class = "left" width = "500">

          <p class = "junction">Stanford got off to a 14-0 start and my dad and I thought it was going to be a blowout. But their Doak Walker Award runningback Montee Ball willed them to two touchdowns. 17-14 Stanford at halftime. The third quarter was a weird one -- with no points and Stanford not even getting a single first down. Tense moments for my dad and I because we could have lost the lead at any moment. Stanford finally cured the scoring drought in the fourth with a field goal to make it 20-14. With about 4 minutes left, Wisconsin had the chance to win with a touchdown but was intercepted by Stanford nickelback Usua Amanam, and the rest was history.</p>

          <p class = "junction">We drove back that same night and got home at about 1:30 AM. I can honestly say that this has been the best sports experience I have ever had. It was a great game that went down to the wire and I will always remember 40,000+ Stanford fans screaming in delight at the game-winning interception. It wasn't just the game, it was the tradition and significance of the Rose Bowl itself -- the nearly 100,000 fans, the tailgate, and the atmosphere in general. I'll always remember this most amazing New Year's Day and here's to the Cardinal making the national championship next year. Hopefully I'll be back in Pasadena again.</p>
